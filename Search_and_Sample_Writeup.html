      <strong>The goals / steps of this project are the following:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Training / Calibration</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"</li>
      <li>Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided</li>
      <li>Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)</li>
      <li>Fill in the <code>process_image()</code> function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The <code>output_image</code> you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.</li>
      <li>Use <code>moviepy</code> to process the images in your saved dataset with the <code>process_image()</code> function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Autonomous Navigation / Mapping</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill in the <code>perception_step()</code> function within the <code>perception.py</code> script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update <code>Rover()</code> data (similar to what you did with <code>process_image()</code> in the notebook).</li>
      <li>Fill in the <code>decision_step()</code> function within the <code>decision.py</code> script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the <code>perception_step()</code> in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands.</li>
      <li>Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.</li>
    </ul>

Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.</h4>
    <p>Initially the functions were researched in a class notes Jupyter notebook on my local machine (while working through the lessons). Halfway through the project time-frame, the Rover_Project_Test_Notebook code was migrated to this forked project in github. At the time of the file migration, the notebook was adding terrain, obstacles and rock sample colors. The colors were stuck at the starting coordinates of the video. The following notes cover the work now recorded in the forked project commits.</p>
    <h5 id="color-threshold-obstacle-and-rock-sample-detection">1.1 Color Threshold Obstacle and Rock Sample Detection</h5>
    <p>At the start, the function color_thresh() only masked pixels above a specified threshold. This worked for collecting navigable terrain, but not for obstacle or rock sample detection. The following changes were made to the default cell in the Rover_Project_Test_Notebook file:</p>
    <p>The color_thresh function was updated to support an RGB range instead of checking above a given threshold. The function was verified with the original warped test image and then the thresholds were tested with normal images.
<img src="%22./calibration_images/example_rock1.jpg%22" alt="rock image" /><img src="./output/terrain_threshed.jpg" alt="terrain_thresh_image" /><img src="./output/obstacle_threshed.jpg" alt="obstacle_thresh_image" /><img src="./output/rock_sample_threshed.jpg" alt="rock_thresh_image" /></p>
    <p>The default range for the lower colors was missing sections of the images, so the threshold check was updated to include the specified values in the mask. This significantly improved the obstacle and sample rock detection, and slightly improved the terrain. The function was modified instead of the threshold values in order to avoid changing parameters throughout the project.

![rock_thresh_image][image_rock_sample_2]</p>
    <p>The world mapping appears to be missing the sample rocks, so another test was made with a warped image.

The</p>
    <p>The color threshold for the sample rock was determined by using the "dropper" feature in inkscape to collect an approximate RGB range. The lesson stated that the obstacles were the opposite threshold of the terrain values.</p>

Populate the <code>process_image()</code> function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a world map.  Run <code>process_image()</code> on your test data using the <code>moviepy</code> functions provided to create video output of your result.</h4>
    <h5 id="populate-the-process_image-todo-items-with-example-code-to-track-the-terrain">2.1 Populate the 'process_image()' TODO items with example code to track the terrain</h5>
    <p>Using the default sample code from the test notebook and lesson examples produced a video where the terrain would be updated in the starting point of the rover. After running the code with a new set of sample data, it appeared that the default code worked as intended and the rover just traveled a short distance. It was confirmed that the longer the rover stays in an area, the more saturated the blue "terrain" pixels would be.</p>
    <h5 id="update-process_image-to-include-obstacles-and-rock-samples-in-the-world-map">2.2 Update 'process_image()' to include obstacles and rock samples in the world map</h5>
    <p>After the initial terrain test was verified, the variable names were updated to report the data is related to terrain tracking and additional code was added to track the obstacles in TODO 2. This looked like unnecessary copying and pasting, so a for loop was added in and the thresholds were tracked as part of an array of RGB tuples. The threshold values were pulled from the experiments in the color_thresh cell.</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-python">rgb_thresh_lower=(160, 160, 160), rgb_thresh_upper=(255, 255, 255) #terrain defaults in function parameters
obstacle_threshed = color_thresh(image, (0, 0, 0), (160, 160, 160))
rock_threshed = color_thresh(image, (125, 100, 0), (200, 200, 75))
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>The for loop started with range(2,3) to verify the code continued to work as intended. The loop was altered to run with the list [0, 2]. This was to test the obstacles next after proving the terrain still worked as intended. With the latest code changes, both obstacles and terrain were successfully tracked. Some reservations about the quality, since the blue areas overlapped the obstacles.</p>
    <p>The loop was then extended to iterate through the full list of items to map (terrain, obstacles and rock samples) and it did not show a rock sample on the map. New data was collected to test out the full list and showed that the colors overlapped to the extent that it impeded observing the rock sample color.</p>

      <strong>Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by <code>drive_rover.py</code>) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.</p>
